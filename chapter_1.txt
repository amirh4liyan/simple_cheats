The program receives a number like N

Since we need factorial calculation to calculate this expression

Must be from 0! up to (N-1)! calculate

You can use recursive function or normal function to calculate factorials

But for the program to be dynamic, looking from bottom to top, we use the array and from 0! We start and get help from the previous sentence to calculate the next sentence

For example, to calculate 4! From the result of 3! We will take advantage of what we calculated before and multiply it by 4 to 4! achieve

Finally, use the for loop to calculate the solution of the sum of each sentence in the expansion of e
